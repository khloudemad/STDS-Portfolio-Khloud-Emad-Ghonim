# STDS Portfolio - Khloud Emad Ghonim

## Portfolio Overview

This portfolio showcases a series of data engineering, analytics, and business intelligence projects developed as part of the **STDS (Selected Topics in Data Science)** course. Each project demonstrates proficiency in different tools, technologies, and methodologies for handling real-world data challenges — from serverless ETL pipelines to interactive dashboards for strategic decision-making.

### Lecture Task: Smart Meter Energy Data ETL Pipeline
A scalable, serverless ETL solution built on AWS to process smart meter readings from over 50,000 households.  
The pipeline automatically ingests raw CSV files, applies rigorous business rules for data cleaning and validation, stores structured data in RDS for real-time querying, and archives optimized Parquet files for long-term analytics. It includes advanced fault detection, retry mechanisms, and error handling to ensure data reliability for energy monitoring, forecasting, and predictive maintenance.

### Excel Task: CRM Sales Performance Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw CRM sales data into actionable insights.  
It enables sales managers to track revenue trends, monitor deal outcomes (Won, Lost, Engaged), evaluate sales agent and manager performance through win rates, and analyze revenue distribution by product, region, sector, and account — supporting faster, data-driven sales strategies.

### Database Excel Task: Education Management System Dashboard
A comprehensive Excel-based analytics solution designed for educational institutions.  
Using pivot tables and interactive visualizations, it provides clear insights into student enrollment, instructor performance, course popularity, grade distributions, and evaluation metrics across departments — empowering administrators to monitor academic trends and make informed operational decisions.

### Power BI Task: AdventureWorks Analytics Dashboard
A professional Power BI solution delivering enterprise-grade business intelligence from the AdventureWorks dataset.  
It offers in-depth visibility into sales performance, financial KPIs (total due, subtotals, taxes, freight), product category analysis, regional comparisons, shipping trends, and temporal patterns — enabling stakeholders to identify growth opportunities and optimize operations.

### Tableau Task: Adidas Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard
An advanced Tableau dashboard analyzing Adidas U.S. sales performance from 2020–2022, encompassing $899.90M in total sales, $332.13M in profit, and 2.48M units sold across 9,648 retailers.  
It provides geographic visualizations, revenue trends, product and retailer performance, sales channel breakdowns (Online, Outlet, In-store), and regional insights — supporting strategic decisions in inventory management, marketing, and market expansion.
