# Reflection: Adidas Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard 👟

## What I Learned 📚
- Advanced Tableau features: geographic maps (state & city level), sales channel breakdowns, and trend analysis over multiple years.
- Visualizing hierarchical data (region → state → city) and profit vs sales correlations.
- Using calculated fields for KPIs and top-N rankings (retailers, products).

## What Was Challenging 🛠️
- Building accurate geographic visualizations with partial location data.

- Creating clean, interactive filters without cluttering the dashboard.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks 🚀

- Better dashboard layout and user experience in Tableau.
- More focus on retail-specific insights (retailers, channels, regions).
