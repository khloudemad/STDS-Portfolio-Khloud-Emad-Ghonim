# Reflection: Education Management System Dashboard 🎓

## What I Learned 📚
- Effective use of Excel PivotTables, slicers, and charts for educational analytics.
- How to track key metrics: enrollment, instructor performance, course popularity, grade distributions, and evaluation categories.
- Designing user-friendly dashboards within Excel constraints.

## What Was Challenging 🛠️
- Cleaning and structuring raw data for meaningful pivots without external tools.
- Creating comparative visuals (e.g., instructors per department, students per course).
- Balancing detail with simplicity in a single workbook.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks 🚀
- More advanced PivotTable techniques and slicer usage than basic Excel exercises.
- Better data storytelling through educational KPIs.
- Improved ability to deliver insights in a constrained environment (Excel only).
